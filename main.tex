\begin{abstract}
In the first part of our study, we consider synchrotron emission from electrons in the Galactic halo region. Utilising a simple analytical expression for the non-thermal electron distribution and a toy magnetic field model, we simulate polarised synchrotron emission maps at 30~GHz. By comparing these maps with observational data, we obtain constraints on our toy magnetic field model parameters. In the second half of our study, we use the range of values obtained for our magnetic field toy model, and determine the arrival directions and suppression factors of ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) from sources with different locations.

\section{Introduction}
\label{Introducion}

% What do we know about magnetic fields?   
The origin and structure of the Galactic magnetic field remains a long standing unresolved problem in astrophysics. What is apparent, however, is the vital role it plays, especially in terms of cosmic ray propagation within the Galaxy. The incompleteness of the observational data, required to probe the Galactic magnetic field structure on many different scales, limits significantly our ability to describe cosmic ray propagation through the Galaxy. This is especially true when it comes to the modelling of cosmic ray propagation out in the Galactic halo where our knowledge of the magnetic field is particularly weak.

%  tools used to detect magnetic fields namely RM and synchrotron. And typical values for these fields
A variety of methods allow observational probes of Galactic magnetic fields, such as starlight polarisation and infrared emission from dust grains, or Zeeman splitting of spectral radio lines in the dust clouds \cite{Beck_2007}. Galactic magnetic fields are also probed by Pulsar dispersion with Faraday rotation, which is sensitive to the magnetic-field component parallel to the line of sight $B_{\parallel}$, and synchrotron radiation which probes the component perpendicular to the line of sight $B_{\perp}$. A major drawback in using the Pulsar dispersion measure along with the Faraday rotation measure method for probing Galactic magnetic fields is that it relies heavily on the lines of sight along which Pulsars are found, which places a strong focus on the regions close to the Galactic plane. Therefore, this method is of most use for probing the magnetic field in the Galactic disc region, and is not so useful for probing the magnetic field out in the Galactic halo. Synchrotron radiation on the other hand is produced via the gyration of non-thermal electrons along magnetic field lines. This method can thus be used to probe magnetic fields also in the Galactic halo.

% Observations from Fermi 
The observations from FERMI-LAT (\cite{Dobler_2010}, \cite{Su_2010} \& \cite{Su_2012}) in the gamma ray regime unveiled giant bipolar gamma ray bubbles extending up to $\approx$~3~kpc radially and $\approx$~8~kpc in the z-direction, having a total energy of $\approx 10^{(54-55)}$~ergs. Recently, observations from eROSITA \cite{eROSITA} in X-ray regime further suggest the existence of even larger bubbles going up to  $\approx$~7~kpc radially and $\approx$~14~kpc in the azimuthal direction, having an estimated total thermal energy of $\approx 10^{56}$~ergs. These observations strongly motivate the requirement of a magnetic field model focusing on the halo. Henceforth, for the sake of simplicity we will address the two bubbles together as the Galactic halo bubbles.

% Observations from S-PASS and Planck
With the help of the aforementioned techniques, we can estimate the strength and direction of the magnetic field in different parts of the Galaxy. 
For the Galactic halo the S-PASS \cite{Carretti_2013} observations  made at 2.3 GHz seem to suggest that the field strength in the halo bubbles can be anywhere between $6-10~\mu $G depending on the proton-electron ratio value adopted. S-PASS \cite{Carretti_2013} observations however are subject to depolarisation of polarised synchrotron radiation via Faraday rotation due to its relatively low observation frequencies. Additionally this data set is not sensitive to a portion of the Fermi bubble region of the sky due to the ground-based location of the instrument allowing only observations in the southern terrestrial hemisphere. For this reason data from Planck and WMAP are more helpful when probing magnetic fields in the Galactic halo due to their all-sky coverage and observation bandwidths which are not sensitive to Faraday rotation effects.

% Short note on non-thermal electron distribution.
Knowledge of non-thermal electron distribution is critical in the modelling of Galactic magnetic fields, which are both required inputs for the determination of synthetic synchrotron maps.
We have direct information on the distribution of cosmic ray electrons at Earth from the observations made by AMS01 \cite{AMS_2002} \& \cite{AMS_2014}, CALET \cite{Calet_2017}, DAMPE \cite{Dampe_2017}. However, we do not have much knowledge of the electron distribution in the Galaxy.
Currently there are a few ways to model the spatial distribution of these relativistic electrons; for example, either on theoretical ground using the GALPROP diffusive transport code \cite{Hammurabi} \cite{Orlando_2011} or on more phenomenological grounds as done in the WMAP data analysis \cite{WMAP_Page}.

% Other magnetic field models and energies in the halo.

Several efforts have been made to model the magnetic fields in the Galaxy, for example by \cite{Jaffe_2010}, \cite{Jaffe_2011}, \cite{Sun_2008}, and \cite{JF12}. It should be noted that our understanding of the magnetic field in the disc region of the Galaxy is much better than that of the halo region due to the larger amount of observational data present at varying frequencies. However, widely used models like JF12 (\cite{JF12}) have also made some efforts towards the modelling of the Galactic halo magnetic field. One drawback of JF12 is that it masks out the Fermi bubble regions in its models, but S-PASS \cite{Carretti_2013} observations tell us that magnetic field strength in this region is not negligible. Therefore, it is important to consider modelling the Galactic halo including the Fermi bubbles.

% \Vasu{makee first  sentence}  \Arjen{Perhaps this paragraph can be extended a bit. Why do we care about the non-thermal electron distribution when talking about the Galactic magnetic field? Why is our knowledge of the non-thermal electron distribution so poor? How can it be measured and how do the models that you mention relate to the measurements?} \Vasu{Currently working on it.}
%However, when modelling Galactic magnetic fields, Galactic cosmic ray electrons are not the only particles of interest. 

% Importance of UHECRs
The propagation of cosmic rays is vital to understand their sources, and this in turn is limited by our understanding of the intervening magnetic fields. Extragalactic cosmic rays (ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) with energies higher than ~$10^{18}$~eV) are constituted by charged protons or nuclei, and their original directions are, therefore, scrambled by the magnetic fields in the path between the source and Earth. The paths of these UHECRs can therefore be drastically changed depending on the strength and geometry of the field. Different models of the Galactic magnetic field give vastly different predictions for the deflection of UHECRs (see e.g.~Ref.~ \cite{JF12}, \cite{FARRAR_2014}, \cite{PT11_2011}, \cite{Sun_2008}, \cite{Sun_2010}). Recently, significant anisotropies in the UHECR sky have been discovered (see \cite{TA_2014} \cite{ICRC_2021} \cite{Auger_Starburst2018} \& \cite{ICRC_2019}. Due to the deflections in the Galactic magnetic fields, the interpretation of these results in terms of the localisation of the UHECR sources is extremely hard and hence, knowledge of Galactic magnetic fields is extremely important.

% Introduction to brief layout of the paper
The structure of this paper is the following. In section~\ref{Methods} we provide a description of the electron distribution and the toy magnetic field model adopted in our study. In section~\ref{Results} synthetic polarised synchrotron maps are produced adopting this model, which are then compared against the Planck data. A grid scan of the model against the data is then made in order to obtain constrained model parameters. In section~\ref{Deflections} we determine the arrival directions of ultra high energy cosmic rays $\rm E = 30$~EeV from our toy model and discuss how the uncertainties in the parameters can propagate errors in estimating the cosmic ray directions. %We also compare results from the toy model and the halo fields from JF12 model.
Lastly, in section~\ref{Conclusions} we summarise our conclusions.


\section{Polarised synchrotron emission}
\label{Methods}

% Toy model introduction and comparison to JF12 
\subsection{Galactic Halo Magnetic Field Model}
\label{GMF}
In this paper we follow the philosophy of \cite{West_Helicity}, adopting a simple toy model as means of a preliminary attempt to provide a model for the Galactic halo bubbles. 

For our toy model we adopt an axisymmetric torroidal structured field, along with a Kolmogorov turbulent field with a power-law spectrum of index $5/3$ given by the following expression:
\begin{equation}\label{TM_equation}
B_{\rm{toy}}= B_{\rm{str}}\rm{e}^{{(-|z|}/Z_{\rm{mag}})} \rm{e}^{(-z_{\rm{min}}/|z|)}\rm{e}^{(-|r|/R_{\rm{mag}})} + B_{\rm{tur}}
\end{equation}
The structured field has 3 free parameters: $B_{\rm str}$ as the strength of the magnetic field, and $R_{\rm {mag}}$ and $Z_{\rm {mag}}$ describing the radial and azimuthal cut off distances, respectively. The model spans radially up to 20~kpc with the observer being centered at earth (-8.5,0,0)~kpc. The direction of the toroidal field is orientated in opposite directions above and below the Galactic plane. A visualisation of our magnetic field in XY and XZ cross-sections is shown in figure[\ref{fig:Vis_TM}]. 

We use CRPropa~3 \cite{CRPropa3_2016} for generating turbulent fields which has a power law spectrum, with the magnitude of this component being $B_{\rm{tur}}$. 
The minimum and maximum values of wavelength to generate these fields are  $L_{\rm min}$ = 200~pc and $L_{\rm max}$ = 400~pc. For computational reasons we stick to this restricted dynamic range of $L_{\rm min}$ and $L_{\rm max}$. The turbulent field has effectively only 1 free parameter which is the magnitude of the turbulent field strength, $ B_{\rm tur}$, with the coherence length of the field being kept fixed at 150~pc.  In appendix~\ref{Appendix_B} we show a power-spectrum plot for this turbulent magnetic field description.

Since, we focus only on the Galactic regions of the sky which probe the Galactic halo, we do not include any disk magnetic field component in this model. For the purposes of comparison, we use the JF12 model as a comparative reference since it is a widely known Galactic magnetic field model.
%We studied each component of the JF12 field separately in order to ascertain how the different components of the Galactic magnetic field model act individually and together. 
However, it should be noted that the JF12 model was motivated by observations which masked out a large part of the Galactic bubble region that we focus on, and adopts magnetic fields strengths and spatial extensions both weaker and smaller than those suggested by the S-PASS observations \cite{Carretti_2013}.

%Discuss the electron distribution
\subsubsection{Electron Distribution}

In order to calculate synthetic synchrotron maps, both a non-thermal electron distribution and magneti field model are required. For the non-thermal electron distribution, the JF12 model considered both the WMAP analytical expression \ref{Eq_WMAP_EdNdE} and simulated electron distribution from GALPROP. They used the latter for their model in their paper. The two models are quite different. The WMAP \cite{WMAP_Page} model is an analytical expression whereas the GALPROP \cite{Hammurabi} is more theoretical in motivation, being obtained from a solution to the diffusive transport equation, assuming a specific spatial distribution for the sources. As our current knowledge of the non-thermal electron distribution in the Galaxy, especially in the Galactic halo region, is very limited, we choose to adopt the simple WMAP analytical model in order to avoid adding further layers of complexity. The WMAP electron density distribution model we adopt has the form:
\begin{equation}\label{Eq_WMAP_EdNdE}
    \frac{\mathrm{d}n_e}{\mathrm{dlog}E_{e}} =     C_\mathrm{norm} \left(\frac{E_e}{\rm E_{\rm 10 GeV}}\right)^{-p+1} e^{-r/R_{\mathrm{el}}} \sech^2\left(\frac{z}{Z_{\mathrm{el}}}\right) 
\end{equation}
where $\frac{\mathrm{d}n_e}{\mathrm{dlog}E_{e}}$ is the differential electron density in logarithmic energy bins, in units of ${\rm cm}^{-3}$, and $p =3$ is the spectral index of the electron spectrum. The parameters, $C_\mathrm{norm}$, describes the electron density for electrons with an energy of 10~GeV, and $R_{\mathrm{el}}$ \& $Z_{\mathrm{el}}$ describe the radial and azimuthal spatial cut-offs.

\subsection{Synchrotron Emission}\label{Synchrotron_theory}

\subsubsection{Intensity \& polarisation}
Synchrotron radiation or magneto-bremsstrahlung radiation is the radiation produced due to charged particles that gyrate at relativistic speeds around a static magnetic field. Synchrotron radiation is sensitive to $B_{\perp}$ which is the magnetic field component perpendicular to the line of sight.The radiation produced via synchrotron is often linearly polarised. 

The polarised emission per unit volume can be visualised as an ellipse where the major axis is the perpendicular component ($J_{\rm \perp}$) and the minor axis is the parallel ($J_{\parallel}$) component. We provide a detailed explanation of this in appendix~(\ref{Appendix_A}). 

The two polarisation emission components, $J_{\perp}$ and $J_{\parallel}$, describe the emission level for a  given peak photon energy $E_{\gamma}^{\mathrm{peak}}$. Expressions for these two components are provided below in eqns~\ref{Jperp} and \ref{Jpara},

%\begin{strip}
\begin{equation}
 {J_{\perp}^l} = t  \int_{\mathrm{log}E_e^{\mathrm{min}}}^{\mathrm{log}E_e^{\mathrm{max}}}\mathrm{dlog}E_{e} \  \frac{\mathrm{d}n_e}{\mathrm{dlog}E_{e}} \  \left[F\left(\frac{E_{\gamma}}{E_{\gamma}^{\mathrm{peak}}}\right) + G\left(\frac{E_{\gamma}}{E_{\gamma}^{\mathrm{peak}}}\right)\right] \
 \label{Jperp}
\end{equation}
%\end{strip}

and,

%\begin{strip}
%\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation}
{J_{\parallel}^l} = t \int_{\mathrm{log}E_e^{\mathrm{min}}}^{\mathrm{log}E_e^{\mathrm{max}}}\mathrm{dlog}E_{e} \ \frac{\mathrm{d}n_e}{\mathrm{dlog}E_{e}} \  \left[F\left(\frac{E_{\gamma}}{E_{\gamma}^{\mathrm{peak}}}\right) - G\left(\frac{E_{\gamma}}{E_{\gamma}^{\mathrm{peak}}}\right)\right] 
\label{Jpara}
\end{equation}
%\end{widetext}
%\end{strip}

\begin{align}
t = \frac{B_{\perp}}{B_{\mathrm{crit}}}\frac{m_{e}}{h} \frac{8\pi \alpha}{9}
\\

G(x) &= x K_{2/3}.
\end{align}
%\Andrew{IN THE ABOVE IT MIGHT BE BETTER TO PROVIDE THE EMISSIVITY OF THE TWO POLARISATION COMPONENTS. DISCUSSION ON LINE-OF-SIGHT INTEGRAL NEEDS ADDING TOO.}
These expressions are provided in terms of the critical magnetic field strength, $B_{\mathrm{crit}} = \frac{m_e^2c^3}{e\hbar} = 4.414 \times 10^{13}$~G , where $m_e = 0.511$~MeV is the mass of electron, $h = 4.136 \times 10^{-15}$~eV~s is the Planck's constant and $\alpha \approx \frac{1}{137.04}$ is the electromagnetic fine structure constant.


For clarity, several of the conventions we adopted are here noted. The parallel component of polarisation (${J_{\parallel}}$) is orientated in the same direction as  $\vec{B_{\perp}}$, and the perpendicular component of polarisation (${J_{\perp}}$) is perpendicular to $\vec{B_{\perp}}$. The Stokes parameters at each point along the line of sight can be written in terms of the intrinsic polarisation angle $\Psi^l_{\rm in}$ which is the angle between the line of sight perpendicular component of the magnetic field $B_{\perp}$ and Galactic south at each step. The conventions adopted here match those used by the Planck collaboration \cite{Planck_XIX} based on the $\rm HEALPix^3$~\footnote{\textcolor{purple}{https://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/}} software by \cite{Healpix_2005}. For each step along the line-of-sight, both  ${J_{\perp}^l}$ and ${J_{\parallel}^l}$ are subsequently used to obtain the $Q$ and $U$ Stokes parameters. We obtain the values of $Q^{\rm tot}_{\rm in}$ and $U^{\rm tot}_{\rm in}$ by integrating it over the line-of-sight volume:

\begin{eqnarray}
Q_{\rm in}^{\rm tot} = \frac{1}{4\pi} {\int_0^L \mathrm{d}l \ ({J_{\perp}^l} - J_{\parallel}^l) \ {\cos}(2\Psi^l_{\rm in}) } \\
U_{\rm in}^{\rm tot} =\frac{1}{4\pi} {\int_0^L \mathrm{d}l \ ({J_{\perp}^l} - J_{\parallel}^l) \ {\sin}(2\Psi^l_{\rm in})} \,
\end{eqnarray}

%\Vasu{Note to self : write ${J_{\perp}^l}$ and $ J_{\parallel}^l)$ to be emission per unit volume and check the same for $Q^l$ and $U^l$}
The polarised flux ($I_{\rm pol}$) can then be expressed in terms of the intrinsic Stokes parameters which are integrated along the line of sight (${Q_{\rm in}}$ \& ${U_{\rm in}}$),
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq_I_pol}
I_{\rm pol} = \sqrt{(Q_{\rm in}^{\rm tot})^2+(U_{\rm in}^{\rm tot})^2} = J_{\perp}^{\rm tot} - J_{\parallel}^{\rm tot}.
\end{eqnarray}
Similarly, $I_{\rm tot}$ is computed by summing the contributions of $J_{\perp}^l$ and and $J_{\parallel}^l$ for each point along the line of sight,
\begin{equation} \label{eq_I_tot}
    I_{\rm tot} = \frac{1}{4\pi} \int_0^L \mathrm{d}l (J_{\perp}^l + J_{\parallel}^l).
\end{equation}
% \Andrew{NEEDS STATING IN A MATHEMATIC LANGUAGE.}
$J_{\perp}^{\rm tot}$ and $J_{\parallel}^{\rm tot}$ are the resultant magnitudes of emissions in perpendicular and parallel directions and can be given by:
\begin{eqnarray}
J_{\perp}^{\rm tot} = (I_{\rm tot} + I_{\rm pol})/2 \\
J_{\parallel}^{\rm tot} = (I_{\rm tot} - I_{\rm pol})/2 
\end{eqnarray}
The intrinsic polarisation angle $\Psi_{\rm in}$ is the resulting angle of polarisation.%\Andrew{This doesn't sound right- this angle describe the angle of the results polarised emission direction wrt Galactic south, not the "local magnetic field component" direction}:
\begin{eqnarray}
\tan(2\Psi_{\rm in}) = \frac{U_{\rm in}^{\rm tot}}{Q_{\rm in}^{\rm tot}} 
\end{eqnarray}
In appendix(\ref{Appendix_A}) an example case for these calculations is provide further understanding.

%% Details of simulation like scanning range, cuts etc
\subsection{Simulation setup for the polarised synchrotron emission}
%% Grid details
Utilising the setup described in the previous section (see section~\ref{Methods}), we generate a synthetic polarised synchrotron emission map for each parameter set of our toy model. The toy model comprises of 5 free parameters, (see table~\ref{Para_table}). The radial cut-off of the magnetic field and electron distribution is kept identical $R_{\mathrm{Mag}}$ = $R_{\mathrm{el}}$ and the same applies to the azimuthal cut-off $Z_{\mathrm{Mag}}$ = $Z_{\mathrm{el}}$. The reason for this constraint is that synchrotron radiation level depends on both non-thermal electron density and magnetic field strength. Thus, even if the spatial extend of the magnetic field differs from the electron distribution, one can only probe the field in the region where both the field and electrons are present. The minimum and maximum value for the spatial parameters are 2~kpc to 19~kpc, which are scanned over in step size of 1~kpc. The range over which both $B_{\rm str}$ and $B_{\rm tur}$ are scanned is 2$~\mu$G to 19$~\mu$G, with a step size of 1$~\mu$G. We calculate the polarised emission for one particular value of $\log_{10}(C_{\rm norm}[{\rm cm}^{-3}]) = -12.43$, and subsequently re-scale these results to obtain the polarised emission maps for different values of  $\log_{10}(C_{\rm norm} [{\rm cm}^{-3}])$, ranging this scan from $-10$ to $-15$ with a step size of $0.3$ (ie. in 20 steps).%from $-9.84$ to $-15.83$ with a step size of $0.24$ (ie. in 25 steps).

%% Handling of data 
In our study, we mask out three regions of the sky from our skymaps. The first of these is in the Galactic disc region between b = $(-15^{\circ},15^{\circ})$. For the second region, based on observations from \cite{eROSITA} and \cite{Su_2010}, we block out longitudes  $\geq \pm 90^{\circ}$ from the Galactic center (ie. all direction pointing away from the Galactic center direction), so as to ensure that our analysis only covers the region occupied by the Galactic Halo (Fermi and eRosita) bubbles. Lastly, we block out the region associated with the North Polar Spur (NPS). Our motivation here is that the higher latitudes of NPS seem to follow a trend to be originating locally rather than from Galactic center based on the starlight polarisation observations \cite{Gina_2021}. In order to remain as impartial as possible for the designation of this region, we adopt a cut for it selected in \cite{Wolleben_2007}. In fig.~\ref{fig:Skymaps} observational and synthetic skymaps are shown with these three regions removed.

%% Skymap comparison and explanation of smoothening method

To obtain best-fit for our model we ran a grid search for over a million configurations. For each toy configuration, a synthetic skymap was generated using Healpix \cite{Healpix_2005}, adopting a resolution with Nside = 32. Since the interests of our study are focused on large scale structures, both the synthetic skymaps and observational data were smoothed out, using a Gaussian kernel, on size scale of $15^{\circ}$, to wash out smaller scale features. We then compare the simulated polarised emission with the Planck data at 30~GHz by evaluating the $\chi^{2}$ value of the model fit to the data. To find the best fit parameters and their constraints, we carry out a grid search over the 5 free parameters, sampling in total two million parameter points.


\subsection{Observational Data}
% discussion of data sets used
For our synchrotron emission study, we use the publicly available data from the Planck satellite mission \footnote{\textcolor{purple}{http://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/}}. Specifically, we use the polarised radio data at 30~GHz from Planck where the peak frequency is at 28.4~GHz, with a band width of 9.8~GHz. At this frequency a considerable level of polarised synchrotron emission is observed, with a only a small level of Faraday rotation occurring at these high frequencies. However, we also note that in this 30~GHz band, the Planck data cannot be used to probe synchrotron intensity directly, since at this frequency the unpolarised sky receives a considerable contributions from both thermal bremsstrahlung and anomalous microwave emission, as well as synchrotron radiation \cite{Planck_XIX} and \cite{Planck_XLII}. 

\subsection{Constraints on Magnetic Field Model}
\label{Results}
%% Details of uncertainities 
We obtained 1$~\sigma$ constraint on our model shown in table~$\ref{Para_table}$. For the structured magnetic field strength $B_{\rm str}$ we obtain the best fit value of 3~$\mu$G with the upper extreme being 11~$\mu$G
and the lower extreme 1~$\mu$G. Similarly, turbulent magnetic fields $B_{\rm tur}$ the mean value is 6~$\mu$G and upper and lower extreme values are 4~$\mu$G and 12~$\mu$G respectively. For spatial dimensions, we obtain a best fit vale of 7~kpc for the azimuthal extent $Z_{\rm Mag}/Z_{\rm el}$ and uncertainities of $\pm$ 1~kpc. These values are in agreement with the observations made by FERMI \cite{Su_2010}, S-PASS \cite{Carretti_2013} and eROSITA \cite{eROSITA}. We do not however, obtain an upper extreme value for $R_{\rm Mag}/R_{\rm el}$ only a lower extreme value of 4~kpc with the best fit value being 5~kpc. Again this best fit value is in agreement with the radial extent as obtained by the observations.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:Skymaps} the smoothened skymap obtained from the best fit value of the parameters and the smoothened polarised Planck data is shown along with the residuals. The best-fit values used for the parameters are provided in table~\ref{Para_table}. 
%% Polarisation fraction
We next estimate the polarisation fraction obtained by our best-fit toy-model which is given in figure \ref{fig:Skymaps} which was calculated taking the ratio of the polarised to the total intensity. The polarisation fraction for the best-fit toy model is comparable to the values as seen in the observation data \cite{Carretti_2013} and \cite{WMAP_Page}.

\section{Cosmic ray deflections from magnetic field model}
\label{Deflections}

Charged particles propagating through magnetic fields, precess around the field lines by virtue of the Lorentz force 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{{\rm d}\bfm{\beta}}{c{\rm d}t} = \frac{1}{r_{L}}\bfm{\beta}\times \bfm{\hat{B}}, 
\end{eqnarray}
where $\bfm{\beta}$ is the particle's velocity vector, and $r_{L}$ is the particle's Larmor radius. UHECRs undergo the same Lorentz force when propagating through Galactic magnetic fields. The extragalactic magnetic field is considered to be weak, with $B < \rm {nG}$ for $\lambda_{\rm coh}=1$~Mpc \cite{Blasi_1999}, \cite{Kronberg_2007}, and the ultra-high energy cosmic rays UHECRs with rigidity R = $E/Z > 10^{19}$ EeV (here Z is the atomic number) subsequently have $r_{L}>{\rm 10~Mpc}$ and are therefore not sensitive to the extragalactic magnetic field over 10~Mpc propagation distance scales. \Arjen{The charge of the CRs is quite important here, but is not mentioned, while it's dangerous to make this statement for any CR with $E > 10^{19}$ EeV. Perhaps this should be changed to rigidity larger than $10^{19}$ EeV? But you would need to define rigidity first than of course.}
However, once they enter the Galaxy, magnetic fields are of the order of a few $\mu$G. In case of a proton at 6~EeV in $6~\mu$G field the $r_L \approx 1 ~ \rm kpc$, this implies that the proton will be subject to deflection by the large scale Galactic magnetic fields.

We use the publicly available cosmic ray propagation code CRPropa~3~\cite{CRPropa3_2016} for studying the effects of toy model magnetic fields on the arrival directions of cosmic rays. Within this software we use the Boris pusher scheme in order to ensure a particle's trajectory evolution satisfies the Lorentz force equation. It is important to note that CRPropa conserves the total energy of each particle during the propagation.
%% Setup description
We propagate $10^7$ cosmic rays starting at Earth isotropically through the toy model using the backtracking scheme up to a distance of 20~kpc from the Galactic center. We use nitrogen as a choice of our cosmic ray particles at 40~EeV with R $= 40/7$~EeV energy. 

\subsection{Effect of Magnetic Field Model on UHECR Arrival}

In figure~\ref{fig:AD_Plots} we show:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The magnification maps in log (particles/str) of the backtracked positions for the cosmic rays (\textbf{left}). These magnification maps are made for the best-fit values (\textbf{top}), the lower bound or minimum values (\textbf{middle}) and the upper bound or maximum values (\textbf{bottom}) of the parameters.
    To create these histograms we used 180 bins for both latitudes and longitudes. 
    We normalise these maps made with the toy model fields by dividing them with maps made without any magnetic fields. In each map the blue regions denote the areas of the sky where cosmic rays are suppressed and the red regions are the ones where the cosmic rays are enhanced.
    
    %\Arjen{Perhaps rather 'boosted' or 'enhanced' instead of abundant?}. 
    
    The UHECR deflections are sensitive to both structured and turbulent fields and therefore the maximum case has a larger region of suppression in comparison to best-fit and minimum cases (see table \ref{Para_table}). This suppression and enhancement of UHECRs is also shown for two potential UHECR sources CenA (lat = $\rm 19.42^{\circ}$, lon = $\rm 50.49^{\circ}$) and NGC 253 (lat = $\rm -87.96^{\circ}$, lon = $\rm 97.36^{\circ}$). Because of their positioning in the sky both the sources lie in the suppression region in the maximum case.
    \item Skymaps for arrival directions
    of cosmic rays from UHECRs sources CenA and NGC 253 on the (\textbf{right}). Similar to the above case of the magnification maps we backtrack cosmic rays starting from Earth till 20~kpc distance from the Galactic centre. We plot the arrival directions of cosmic rays that came from a region of $5^{\circ}$ from the source.  Like the magnification maps, we normalise these maps with no magnetic field maps.  This gives us a normalised value of the number of hits obtained. Analogous to magnification maps the \textbf{top}, \textbf{middle} and \textbf{bottom} plots denote the best-fit, minimum and maximum cases. We also estimate the mean value of the $5^{\circ}$ spread and the mean direction denoted by a \tikzcircle[black,fill = black]{2pt}. 
    The standard deviation for each source in each case is as follows:
     \begin{enumerate}
        \item Best fit $\sigma_{\rm NGC 253} = 21^{\circ}$ , {$\sigma_{\rm Cen A} = 20^{\circ}$}
        \item Minimum $\sigma_{\rm NGC 253} = 14^{\circ}$ , $\sigma_{\rm Cen A} = 14^{\circ}$
        \item Maximum $\sigma_{\rm NGC 253} = 39^{\circ}$, $\sigma_{\rm Cen A} = 35^{\circ}$

    \end{enumerate}
    % \begin{enumerate}
    %     \item Best fit $\sigma^2_{\rm NGC 253} = $ 0.13~str ($\sigma_{\rm NGC 253} = 20.65^{\circ}$ ), $\sigma^2_{\rm Cen A} =$ 0.12~str, {($\sigma_{\rm Cen~~}=20^{\circ}$)}
    %     \item Maximum $\sigma^2_{\rm NGC 253} = $0.46~str ($\sigma_{\rm NGC 253} = 26.4^{\circ}$), $\sigma^2_{\rm
    %     Cen A} = $0.37~str , {($\sigma_{\rm Cen~~}=35^{\circ}$)}
    %     \item Minimum $\sigma^2_{\rm NGC 253} = $~0.061~str ($\sigma_{\rm NGC 253} = 3.5^{\circ}$), $\sigma^2_{\rm Cen A} = $~0.066~str {($\sigma_{\rm Cen~~}=14^{\circ}$)}
    %     \newline
    %     \Andrew{perhaps better to quote $\sigma_{a}= b^{\circ}$} \Arjen{I would probably only show the $\sigma_{a}= b^{\circ}$ cases, not the 'str' cases. And the labels of $\sigma_{a}$ are not always correct.}
    % \end{enumerate}

    It can be seen that in the maximum case it is harder to associate the cosmic rays to a source in comparison to the best-fit or minimum case. This is due to the fact that though structured fields are responsible for the direction of deflection, turbulent fields spread out the deflections over the entire sky.
   
    % \Vasu{Have addressed your comment!}
    % This is due to the fact that though structured fields dictate the direction of the deflection the turbulent fields spread out the directions. This is why when the turbulent fields are stronger the arriving directions are spread out entirely over the sky. \Arjen{These last two sentences can be improved. Perhaps something more simple like 'This is because the stronger structured and turbulent fields spread out the deflections over the entire sky.'?}
    \end{enumerate}
    
From both the magnification and arrival direction maps in \ref{fig:AD_Plots}. it is evident that the best fit and lower extreme (minimum) parameters can clearly help in associating the deflected particles with their potential source. However, in the upper extreme (maximum) parameters any connection between the point of origin of cosmic rays and their final positions is inconclusive. 


It can be seen that for the 'Maximum' case in fig~\ref{fig:AD_Plots}, cosmic rays from sources like NGC 253 get completely deflected by the magnetic field and hence we obtain a suppressed flux $\approx 5\%$ as seen also in the bottom-right figure~\ref{fig:AD_Plots}. Likewise, in the case of Centaurus A the final positions are spread out on the entire sky making it impossible to associate it with the source.

\Arjen{I think it would be good to mention the suppression of NGC~253 clearly in a separate sentence, stating specifically that this is why there are hardly any cosmic rays coming from this source in the bottom right plot.}

\section{Conclusions}
\label{Conclusions}
%Our study highlights the importance that Galactic halo magnetic fields and non-thermal electrons can play in explaining the wide-field radio observations of these regions. It is important to note that for equipartition of energy \cite{Drury_2012} to be valid if magnetic fields dominate then electron density has to be lower.
%By definition of equipartition of energy the ratio between thermal pressure and magnetic pressure also known as plasma $\beta$ condition the magnetic the total energy in magnetic fields should be comparable to thermal particles \cite{Drury_2012}.
Utilising a toy model for the halo Galactic magnetic field, and making comparisons of the synchrotron emission predicted by it to the Planck 30~GHz data, we explore the region of model parameters that provides a good description of the data. Significant evidence is found for the presence of an extended field component out in the Galactic halo region. Our results are compatible with the Galactic halo magnetic field extending to 7~kpc in height above the Galactic disk. The total magnetic field content in the halo region from our model fits is $\approx 10^{55}$~ergs (with a comparable total energy in cosmic ray protons at 1 GeV, $\approx 4\times 10^{55}$~ergs). We note that these values are comparable with observational inference made in \cite{eROSITA}, which indicated the presence of some $10^{56}$~erg of thermal particles in Galactic halo. In comparison to these energy contents, the total magnetic field energy content in the halo field component of the JF12 model is $4\times 10^{54}$~ergs and $3\times  10^{54}$~ergs for the torroidal halo and X-field respectively \cite{Taylor_2019}.

Using the maximum and minimum constraints on magnetic field model parameter values, the range of deflection that UHECR experience in passing through such Galactic halo magnetic field structure was subsequently investigated. A significant range in prediction of both: a) the magnification of different regions of the extragalactic sky; b) the deflection of CR arriving from different local extragalactic sources was found.

\Arjen{I would be a bit more specific here. Perhaps mention the minimal and maximal spread and/or magnification.}

One of the limitations in our model is that we assume that the magnetic field and electron density have an exponential cut-off, where as in reality they would have a power-law shape \cite{Drury_2012} \cite{Hammurabi} \cite{Eck_2015}. This implies that we could be underestimating the parameter values we obtain. The second limitation of our model is the coherence lengths of the magnetic fields, we use $L_{\rm coh} \approx 150$~kpc which might be too large for the real world scenario. However, our aim is to study the large scale magnetic fields and use polarised synchrotron emission to probe them. Therefore, fields of small coherence lengths ($L_{\rm coh} < 100 - 150 $~pc) will not have a strong effect on the polarised intensity

\Arjen{If you mention these limitations, you should also discuss why it's not that bad, or not that important anyway. Or why they are justified. Stating it like this makes it sound like nobody should care about your results as they might not be correct due to these limitations anyway.}

\section{Polarised Synchrotron Emission}
\label{Appendix_A}
As discussed in section(\ref{Synchrotron_theory}) the line of sight components for Stokes parameters is given by:
\begin{eqnarray}
Q^l_{\rm in} = ({J_{\perp}^l} - J_{\parallel}^l) \ {\cos}(2\Psi^l_{\rm in}) \ \\ U^l_{\rm in} = ({J_{\perp}^l} - J_{\parallel}^l) \ {\sin}(2\Psi^l_{\rm in}) \ .
\end{eqnarray}
We can take two test cases (I \& II) given in figure(\ref{fig_tot_intensity}) and figure (\ref{fig_pol_intensity}) respectively.We consider that there are two steps along a line of sight for which ${J_{\perp}^{(1,2)}}$ = 0.85 and $J_{\parallel}^{(1,2)}$  = 0.15. 
\\ In case I the angles $\Psi_{\rm in}^{(1,2)}$ = $90^{\circ}$ \& $0^{\circ}$. The resultant value of $I_{\rm pol}$ = 0 by virtue of eq.(\ref{eq_I_pol}) and we only have a contribution in $I_{\rm tot}$. This implies that for case I the resultant emission is seen only in total intensity since the values of $J_{\perp}^{\rm tot}$ = $J_{\parallel}^{\rm tot}$. 
\\ In case II we apply similar calculations to case I however, now the angles are $\Psi_{\rm in}^{(1,2)}$ = $90^{\circ}$ \& $45^{\circ}$. This in turn results in contribution to both polarised emission $I_{\rm pol}$ and total intensity $I_{\rm tot}$. Thus the values of $J_{\perp}^{\rm tot} \neq J_{\parallel}^{\rm tot}$. In figure(\ref{fig_pol_intensity}) we only show polarised intensity for simplicity however, there will be both total intensity and polarised intensity present.

\section{Turbulent Magnetic Field}
\label{Appendix_B}
As discussed in section ~\ref{GMF} we generate the turbulent fields for our model using CRPropa3 ~\cite{CRPropa3_2016}. We the minimum and maximum wavelength we use to generate these fields are 
$L_{min}$ = 200 pc and $L_{max}$ = 400 pc and $L_{coh} \approx $~150 kpc. One of the major reasons why we do not have enough decades covered for the wavelength is because of the time it takes to generate these fields using CRPropa. 
We looked at power spectrum for different realisations of the turbulent field. In figure ~\ref{fig:PowerSpectrum} we plot power spectrum in X,Y and Z directions, after averaging over the other two directions. We chose a step size of 1~pc and integrate up to $\approx 9\times10^4$~pc. We chose this particular realisation since it followed closely a power law spectrum of index (5/3), with a similar amount of power in each direction (ie. was reasonably isotropic).
